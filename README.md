## Back Story
I find myself on the go a lot. Luckily for me, over the past few years my network has extended into many cities. Now when I visit somewhere away from home I ask myself, who do I know here? I've always had a particularly hard time deciphering between the sexes in my addressbook. As a single guy and an avid party host, determining what girls I could potentially invite on a date or to whatever event was a question posed many a night. Many would argue that step 1 is to have those particular numbers in your phone, but after that it was up to you to find those numbers. I've always wanted an easy way to split my contacts by gender. With this app, I aim to solve this problem. 

This app is a very rough draft of what I hope will become a very seamless and helpful experience. The app currently instructs the user to add contacts from their address book into the respective 'filters'. The future iterations will ideally provide the ability to call from app, filter suggestions for imported contacts, and notifications. A vital feature for this app to be used as its intended (for organization) will rely on reminding the user to add any new contacts to a "filter". I hope to add notification support that is triggered on new entries into the address book.

## Instructions
- Use XCode to run app
- Verify your identity in XCode is configured (for Team and Bundle Identity)
- Allow permissions to access Contacts when prompted on your iPhone
- If you receive an "Untrusted Developer" warning, go to your iPhone Settings -> General -> Device Management and allow developer app.
